# Blame the Game
Game made in Unity.
Game was made for the GmtkGameJam2023. The theme was "roles reserved".
This game is monopoly, but the twist is that you aren't playing it yourself. You are the rng god of the world and decide which number the npc rolls. The aim of the game is complete certain objectives as fast as possible.
